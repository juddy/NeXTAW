030915	Toggle again: the check mark displayed in the wrong place
	when the widget wasn't its default height.
	Added code to the Command Redisplay function so it doesn't
	shift the text when the widget is a Toggle in check or radio
	style. That's really ugly because we're depending
	on how the widget is subclassed. But it works.

030913	The new highlighting code broke with the Toggle widget
	in radio or check style.

030912	Fixed function prototypes in Toggle.c and fixed bugs
	caused by not having them in the first place.

030903	Eliminated warnings caused by missing #includes.

030902	Scrollbar: Added XtNarrowStyle resource to make arrows in the
	style of Windows ("win95") or NeXt ("next", default).
	UPDATE: This was later backed out.

030902	Scrollbar: Made the bump on the thumb optional (resource
	XtNdrawBump, default True).

030901	ThreeD: Added XtNbevel resource to make the bevel "solid"
	(Motif/Xaw3d-like) or "rounded" (neXtaw, default).
	Added the same code to neXtawDrawShadowBox in Misc.c, which
	is used by Scrollbar and SimpleMenu.
	Added a 3D bevel to Text using a similar hack as in Xaw95.

030831	Command, Repeater and Toggle: Draw a dotted rectangle around
	the highlighted widget. Reduced the distance the text shifts
	in a set widget to 1 pixel.

030824	Added traversal code from Ed Falk's XawM. Note: KDE messes up
	translations for the Command widget. That is a bug in KDE.

030823	Released 0.14.1.

030823	Patch from Alexey I. Froloff <raorn@altlinux.ru>:
	This patch adds shadow width to SimpleMenu widget's height
	(last Sme overlaps with bottom shadow) and fixes SmeBSB drawing
	code (different regions were highlighted in Redisplay and
	FlipColors, "disabled" menu items were displayed as normal if
	.international is set to True).

030227	Updated selection code in Text widget. Removed support for
	cut buffers. Added support for CLIPBOARD. Changed keybindings:
	Ctrl-C = copy selection to clipboard
	Ctrl-X = cut selection to clipboard
	Ctrl-V = paste clipboard
	Page_Up = page up
	Page_Down = page down
	Home = beginning of line
	Ctrl-Home = beginning of file
	End = end of line
	Ctrl-End = end of file
	New configuration option --enable-obsolete-selections reverts
	to the old code.

030204	Check for the existence of widec.h (c/o Matthias Buelow).

030115	Patches by Alexey I. Froloff:
	"NeXtish" scrollbar look (thumb and buttons are wider and
	look more flat).
	Fixed thumb positioning for Button2 scrolling.
	Released 0.13.0.

020828	Added scrollwheel support and a fix for horizontal scrollbars.
	Changed default beNiceToColormap to False.

020314	More fixes by Andreas Voegele: a patch to acinclude.m4
	to add -DNARROWPROTO only for systems that need it.
	Released 0.12.

020126	Added -DNARROWPROTO and a bunch of Makefile fixes by
	Andreas Voegele <voegelas@users.sourceforge.net>.
	Released 0.11.

020104  Added checks for wslen, wscpy and wsncpy in XawI18n.h.
	Fixed neXtclock Makefile.am so it works with the new libtool.

011220	Updated automake, autoconf and libtool.

011213	Released 0.10.

011212	Tested on Linux and Solaris.

011211	Most (relevant) compiler warnings were fixed.

011210	Converted to autoconf.
	Directory structure was reorganised.
