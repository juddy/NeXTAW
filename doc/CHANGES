Changelog for neXtaw version 0.9
================================

Changes since version 0.8:
- Scrollbal does not have the drawBorder resource anymore. It was not useful
  except for xterm (and not very much).
- A patch from Kevin Ryde fixed a bug in the Scrollbar widget that could lead
  to a BadPixmap protocol error when such a widget was destroyed.
- Small patch from Stasinos Konstantopoulos to compile with native HP-UX
  compiler.
- Fixed a bug in the MultiSrc widget after a report from Kevin Ryde. An
  asciiText widget created with XtNinternational True attempts to free the
  string passed to it in an XtSetValues XtNstring (on the second and
  subsequent such calls). This was already fixed in XFree86 3.3.5 Xaw but not
  in Xaw3d 1.5.  It seems that some fixes in Xaw were not propagated to Xaw3d
  and the other replacement libraries.

Changes since version 0.7:
- Do not include widec.h in XawI18n.h for Linux (this file does not exist in
  new distributions with glibc2).  Bug report from Scott Petinga.
- Moved doc/README.neXtaw to README at top-level to easier access.  Better
  documentation on compilation.
- Fixed Imakefiles for standalone compilation.

Changes since version 0.6:
- Included a new target in Imakefile, "standalone", to make easier to build
  neXtaw out of the standard X11 build tree.  Added documentation to the
  README file about compilation.
- Patch based on input from Daniel Pittman to make the Scrollbar initial delay
  and repeat rate configurable using X resources.
- Small cosmetic changes in source code.

Changes since version 0.5.1:
- Included a patch from Stefan Monnier to fix Xaw3d habit of ignoring
  XawScrollbarSetThumb requests while dragging the thumb. It also fixes the
  behavior of preventing the application from moving the thumb past `1.0 -
  scrollbar.shown'.  Without this patch, Emacs' scrollbar (when using
  Xaw-style scrollbars) behaves very poorly when reaching the end of the
  buffer.
- Restored the original Xaw Text class. This fixes the "crazy scrollbar"
  problem, but the 3D relief is gone.
- TextSrc.c was took from the later Xaw
- Incorporated the Clock widget from the original xclock and added 3D look.
- neXtaw 0.6 is now based in Xaw3d version 1.5, but includes a newer
  version of XawIm.c (1998/04/21).  This fixes the installation path of
  include files and supersedes the patches from neXtaw.diffs.tar.gz
- Added support to character composition with dead-keys in AsciiSink. A
  corresponding patch is available for Xaw and Xaw3d too.
- Changed cursor shape in MultiSink to make it consistent with AsciiSink.
- Removed MyInsertCursor (merged into the InsertCursor method).

Changes since version 0.5:
- Text widget bug that manifested in chimera fixed.

Changes since version 0.3:
- Fixed the text widget bug in ScEd
- Added a DrawArrows resource to scrollbars
- Added checkbox and radiobutton styles to toggles
- Removed the lines that separated menu entries, because they were not 
  looking the way I wanted. You can bring them back by removing
  the -DNO_MENU_LINES define in Imakefile and recompiling.
- Added scrolling for menus that don't fit in the screen, like the
  one in xfontsel. The code is not very pretty, but hey! We're the only
  Athena flavor, AFAIK, that can do it!! :-)
- Added indicators for menuButtons
