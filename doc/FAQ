This FAQ is probably outdated, but I could not work to fix it yet.

[1] I've compiled neXtaw without problems, moved it to /usr/X11/lib,
changed symlinks from libXaw* to libneXtaw.so.6.0 but when I try to run 
someapp, I get a "someapp: can't find library 'libXaw.so.6'" message.

Look at README.neXtaw and see step 4 of the compilation instructions.

OR

Relink your applications with -lneXtaw instead of -lXaw


[2] I've installed neXtaw correctly, but I can't get it to look 
like your screen shots.

Append Xdefaults to your .Xdefaults or .xsession, then run
xrdb ~/.Xdefaults

Also look at question 3.


[3] I have configured .Xdefaults with the correct settings, but
when I run xterm/kterm/color_xterm/nxterm the scrollbar color does 
not have the right color, or scrollbar appears black (or white) when
it should be gray.

Are you running xterm with arguments like  ``xterm -bg black -fg white -sb'' ?
If so, don't exec xterm with ``-bg black -fg white''. If you want your
xterm background to have a different color than the default, edit
.Xdefaults and add:
*VT100.background:	black
*VT100.foreground:	white

then run xterm without any color parameters. 
The same thing applies to most other applications.

[4] Appending the included Xdefaults file or changing .Xdefaults have 
no effect.

Try modifying .xsession instead of .Xdefaults
Also see if the app you're trying to change is dynamically linked to libXaw.
Some apps that come with RedHat are statically linked, which means you
have to get/compile a dynamically linked version of that app.
You can see if that's the case by typing something like:

ldd /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm

If a line like:
   libXaw.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.6
does not appears, then you have a statically linked version.
