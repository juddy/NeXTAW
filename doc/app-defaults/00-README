These are some app-defaults files that I use with neXtaw an Xaw3d.
Use them whith care and at your own risk.

If you want to try some of these files without overriding the existing ones,
copy them to a private directory, say $HOME/app-defaults and set the
environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to include the full path:

    for Bourne shell (sh, ksh, zsh, bash, ash):

	XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=$HOME/app-defaults
	export XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

    for chsh and tcsh:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/app-defaults

And remenber, make a backup of your old files before install these over them!
