Immediate plans
---------------

Only show the caret when the Text widget has focus.

---

Text again: fix the caret blinking code, which seems only slightly broken.

---

Make focus policy a resource.

---

Distinguish between pointer focus and keyboard focus.

---

Setting keyboard focus explicitly messes up the focus of
the keyboard traversal code.

---

Text: Scroll horizontally to keep the caret visible.

---



Plans for the future
--------------------

Since neXtaw (and its relatives Xaw3d, XawM and so on) are not exactly
bleeding edge, there is no rush to implement lots of new
features. The library is mostly fine as it is, within the limitations
of the Xaw3d API. The most important thing is to keep the library
up to date, to prevent bit rot and make sure that it remains useful.

But that would be boring, and we can't have that. Here is, therefore,
a small wishlist that will be implemented as time and interest permits.
Anyone is invited to participate, either with these goals or ones
of your own.


More widgets
------------

There are lots of widgets in Siag Office and other sources that would
make a useful addition to many applications. See, for example,
Ed Falk's survey.

Rather than adding them to neXtaw, which would make it incompatible
with other libraries, they should go into a separate library.

From the top of my head, this includes:

 - The whole menu kit
 - Combo widget
 - Tab widget
 - File selector widget
 - Text field
 - Tree widget


Features from elsewhere
-----------------------

 - XawM has keyboard traversal. Done!
 - XawXpm has amazing eyecandy capability
 - Aterm has fake background transparency
